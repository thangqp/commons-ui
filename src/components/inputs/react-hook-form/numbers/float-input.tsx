// toLocaleString never uses exponential notation unlike toString.  Avoiding
// exponential notation makes in place normalizing of numbers after each
// keystroke less intrusive: we can almost always normalize to a number that
// uses the same string representation as the intermediate text that the user
// typed. For example, if the user wants to input "625", they will write "6"
// and then "62" and then "625". The intermediate strings are numbers that have
// nothing in common with the final number but their normalization is the
// same as what was typed by the user. With exponential notation, if the user
// wants to input "12.5e21", at the intermediate step of "12.5e2" their input
// is normalized to "1.25e3" and after adding the final "1" they get "12.5e31"
// instead of "12.5e21".
// Note: with 16+ digits, two small problems in the current implementation appear:
//   - rounding due to precision causes the cursor to jump at the end.
//   - rounding due to precision causes the last digits of the number to jiggle.
// These two problems should be fixable with manual rounding and cursor
// handling if we need it.

        // when the user finally writes a non 0 digit at the end, the normalization takes place
        // and may startle the user when changing a lot of its input text.

        //      -    1231231231241231241231245123124234234123123124234.
